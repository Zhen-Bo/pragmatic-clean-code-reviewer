  Strict code review following Clean Code, Clean Architecture, and The Pragmatic Programmer 
  principles. Use when: (1) reviewing code or pull requests, (2) detecting code smells or 
  quality issues, (3) auditing architecture decisions, (4) preparing code for merge, 
  (5) refactoring existing code, or (6) checking adherence to SOLID, DRY, YAGNI, KISS principles.
  Features a 3+4+2 questionnaire system to calibrate strictness from L1 (lab) to L5 (critical).
  Also triggers on: "is this code good?", "check code quality", "ready to merge?", 
  "technical debt", "code smell", "best practices", "clean up code", "refactor review".

# Pragmatic Clean Code Reviewer

Strict code review following Clean Code, Clean Architecture, and The Pragmatic Programmer principles.

**Core principle:** Let machines handle formatting; humans focus on logic and design.

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP: Project Positioning

**STOP! Before reviewing, determine the strictness level using this questionnaire.**

### Q1: Who will use this code?

| Code | Option | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| D1 | 🧑 **Solo** | Only myself |
| D2 | 👥 **Internal** | Team/company internal |
| D3 | 🌍 **External** | External users/open source |

### Q2: What standard do you want?

| Code | Option | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| R1 | 🚀 **Ship** | Just make it work |
| R2 | 📦 **Normal** | Basic quality |
| R3 | 🛡️ **Careful** | Careful review |
| R4 | 🔒 **Strict** | Highest standard |

### Q3: How critical? (Conditional)

> **Only ask if:** (D2 or D3) AND (R3 or R4)

| Code | Option | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| C1 | 🔧 **Normal** | General feature, can wait for fix |
| C2 | 💎 **Critical** | Core dependency, outage if broken |

### Quick Lookup Table

| D | R | C | Level | Example |
|---|---|---|-------|---------|
| D1 | R1 | - | L1 | Experiment script |
| D1 | R2 | - | L1 | Personal utility |
| D1 | R3 | - | L2 | Personal long-term project |
| D1 | R4 | - | L3 | Personal perfectionist |
| D2 | R1 | - | L1 | Team prototype |
| D2 | R2 | - | L2 | Team daily dev |
| D2 | R3 | C1 | L2 | Internal helper tool |
| D2 | R3 | C2 | L3 | Internal SDK |
| D2 | R4 | C1 | L3 | Internal tool (high std) |
| D2 | R4 | C2 | L4 | Internal core infra |
| D3 | R1 | - | L2 | Product MVP |

## Strictness Matrix & Metric Thresholds

**Quick reference:**
- Function length: L2(≤80) → L3(≤50) → L4(≤30) → L5(≤20)
- Parameter count: L2(≤7) → L3(≤5) → L4(≤3) → L5(≤2)
- Test coverage: L2(30%) → L3(60%) → L4(80%) → L5(95%)

**For complete matrices:** See [positioning.md](references/positioning.md#strictness-matrix)

### ⚠️ Measurement Rules (MUST follow)

1. **Count logic lines only** — exclude docstrings, comments, blank lines
2. **Metrics are conversation starters, not hard gates**
3. **Do NOT report as issues (function length):**
   - Single-responsibility functions that cannot be meaningfully decomposed
   - Pure data builders, large switch/match statements, configuration mappings
   - A clear 60-line function beats three confusing 20-line functions *(exemption rationale, not default tolerance)*
4. **Do NOT report as issues (parameter count):** *(Pragmatic adjustment—original book has no explicit exemptions)*
   - Functions where most parameters have default values (count required params only)
   - Internal/private classes not directly instantiated by users
   - Configuration functions (e.g., `configure_logging(level="INFO", ...)`)
   - Factory/Builder patterns controlled by framework
5. **Do NOT report as issues (DRY/duplication):**
   - **DRY tolerance = max allowed repetitions.** Report when occurrences **exceed** this number:
     - L5: max 1 → report on 2nd occurrence
     - L4: max 2 → report on 3rd occurrence
     - L3: max 3 → report on 4th occurrence
     - L2: max 4 → report on 5th occurrence
     - L1: N/A (no limit)
   - **Accidental duplication** *(all levels)*: Similar code representing different business knowledge—do NOT report even if exceeds tolerance. Quick test: "If one changes, must the other ALWAYS change?" If no → accidental duplication → keep separate.
   - **Same file** *(L1-L3 only)*: Duplicates within same file are lower risk

## Language-Aware Review

Before reviewing, identify the language paradigm:

| Paradigm | Languages | Clean Code Applicability |
|----------|-----------|-------------------------|
| Pure OOP | Java, C# | ✅ Full |
| Multi-paradigm | TypeScript, Python, Kotlin | ⚠️ Adjust |
| Functional | Haskell, Elixir, F# | ⚠️ Many rules don't apply |
| Systems | Rust, Go | ⚠️ Different patterns |

**For language-specific adjustments:** See [language-adjustments.md](references/language-adjustments.md)

## Red Flags - Investigate Further

> ⚠️ **Language-aware:** Some red flags are paradigm-dependent. Always check [language-adjustments.md](references/language-adjustments.md) first.

If you notice any of these, consult the reference files:

- Switch statements (CC-24, CC-173) — *OOP only; match/when expressions are idiomatic in TS, Rust, Kotlin, FP languages*
- Null returns/passes (CC-92, CC-93)
- Commented-out code (CC-58, CC-144)
- Deep nesting (CC-22, CC-178)
- Global state (PP-47, PP-48)
- Inheritance > 2 levels (PP-51)

---

## DO NOT Review (Machine's Job)

These should be caught by Linter/Formatter:

- Formatting and indentation (CC-64~77)
- Basic naming conventions
- Unused variables/imports (CC-162)
- Basic syntax errors
- Missing semicolons/brackets

**Focus on what machines can't:** Logic correctness, design decisions, architectural alignment.

---

## Report Format

> **Before reporting:** Apply Measurement Rules exemptions. Do NOT include exempt items (e.g., pure data builders exceeding line limits) in any issue category—omit them entirely.

```markdown
## 📋 Code Review Report

**Project Positioning:** [Level] (e.g., L3 Team)
**Review Scope:** [files/commits reviewed]

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- [file:line] Issue description
  - **Rule:** XX-## (Rule Name)
  - **Principle:** Brief explanation of why this matters
  - **Suggestion:** How to fix it

### 🟡 Important Issues (Should Fix)
- [file:line] Issue description
  - **Rule:** XX-## (Rule Name)
  - **Principle:** Brief explanation of why this matters
  - **Suggestion:** How to fix it

### 🔵 Minor Issues (Nice to Have)
- [file:line] Issue description
  - **Rule:** XX-## (Rule Name)

### ✅ Strengths
- What's done well

### 📝 Verdict
[✅ Ready to merge / ⚠️ Needs fixes / 🚫 Major rework needed]
```

### Report Example

```markdown
## 📋 Code Review Report

**Project Positioning:** L3 Team
**Review Scope:** src/services/user.ts, src/utils/helpers.ts

### 🔴 Critical Issues (Must Fix)
- [user.ts:45] SQL query built with string concatenation
  - **Rule:** PP-72 (Keep It Simple and Minimize Attack Surfaces)
  - **Principle:** String concatenation in SQL queries creates injection vulnerabilities
  - **Suggestion:** Use parameterized queries: `db.query('SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?', [userId])`

### 🟡 Important Issues (Should Fix)
- [helpers.ts:120] Function `processUserData` has 8 parameters
  - **Rule:** CC-26 (Function Arguments) + CC-147 (Too Many Arguments)
  - **Principle:** Many parameters increase cognitive load and make testing difficult. L3 threshold is ≤5.
  - **Suggestion:** Group related parameters into a `UserDataOptions` object

- [user.ts:200] Duplicate validation logic (3rd occurrence)
  - **Rule:** PP-15 (DRY) + CC-37 (Don't Repeat Yourself)
  - **Principle:** L3 allows max 3 repetitions. This is the 3rd occurrence—consider extracting.
  - **Suggestion:** Extract to `validateUserInput(input)` function in utils

### 🔵 Minor Issues (Nice to Have)
- [helpers.ts:55] Magic number `86400`
  - **Rule:** CC-175 (Replace Magic Numbers with Named Constants)

### ✅ Strengths
- Clear separation between data access and business logic
- Consistent error handling pattern
- Good test coverage on core functions

### 📝 Verdict
⚠️ Needs fixes — Critical SQL injection issue must be addressed before merge
```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Correct Approach |
|---------|----------------|------------------|
| Skipping positioning | Wrong strictness applied | Always ask Q1/Q2/Q3 first |
| Treating metrics as gates | Clear 60-line fn > confusing 20-line ones | Metrics trigger discussion |
| Ignoring language paradigm | OOP rules ≠ Rust/Go | Check language-adjustments first |
| Reviewing formatting | Linters do this better | Focus on logic and design |
| Citing rules without context | "CC-20" alone doesn't help | Add: "Function too long: consider extracting X" |
| Missing forest for trees | All style issues but miss security | Priority: security > correctness > design > style |

---

## The Bottom Line

1. **Always calibrate:** Project level determines strictness
2. **Cite rules:** Every issue references a rule code
3. **Focus on logic:** Let machines handle formatting
4. **Be pragmatic:** Rules serve the code, not vice versa
